# Drum-Kit
I built a simple interactive website where users can play sounds by clicking buttons or pressing keys on their keyboard. Each button corresponds to a unique sound, creating a fun and responsive experience. The site uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with event listeners to handle user interactions smoothly.
